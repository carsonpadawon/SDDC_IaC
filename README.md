# Deploying and Managing your SDDC with IaC
The scripts in this repo were built for the consumption of anyone interested in building an VMware Cloud on AWS Software Defined DataCenter (SDDC), configure NSXT and build out VMs. Then use Ansible to manage those VMs that were deployed.

This repo is a work in progress and will be continuously updated.  Please check back often.

**NOTE:** I have removed any specific data to my setup and environment.  So you will need to setup those pieces before the script will work.  Please see below as to what needs to be setup for the script to work.
